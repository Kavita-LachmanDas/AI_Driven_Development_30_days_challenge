# AIDD 30-Day Challenge — Task 6


## Task 6: Linking GitHub MCP Server with Google Gemini CLI

My task is to connect the GitHub MCP Server to the Google Gemini CLI by using the **Hosted (Remote) MCP Server** option.

## What this task includes
- Creating a connection between Gemini CLI and the GitHub MCP Server  
- Using the **remote/hosted MCP setup**, so nothing needs to be installed locally  
- No need for Docker, containers, or running an MCP server on my own machine  

## Objective
After the setup is complete, Gemini will be able to:
- Access and read GitHub repositories  
- Perform actions directly on GitHub through the MCP interface  
- Help automate coding tasks, file updates, and repository operations  

## Additional Notes
- This method is the **quickest and most beginner-friendly**  
- Everything runs online, so it works even on low-spec devices  
- Only a stable internet connection and correct API permissions are needed
